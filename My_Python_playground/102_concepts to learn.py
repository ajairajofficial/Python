"""
Design Patterns: Look into common design patterns like factory, observer, strategy, etc.
Design patterns are typical solutions to common programming problems.

SOLID Principles: Learn principles like single responsibility, open/closed, 
Liskov substitution etc. These help build more modular and maintainable object-oriented code.

Test Driven Development: Writing tests before code using principles like unit testing helps 
create more robust and well-tested OO programs.

Framework Usage: Learn a popular object-oriented framework like Django/Rails (Web dev), 
PyTorch/TensorFlow (ML) to see OOP applied to large programs.

Data Structures and Algorithms: Implement key data structures like stacks, queues, trees using 
OOP principles. This improves problem solving skills.
