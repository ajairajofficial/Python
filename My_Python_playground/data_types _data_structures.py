###############  Python Objects and Data Structure (DS)  ###########################

# ****************** Python Data Types/Objects & Data Structure (DS) ***************************************

# Boolean            bool   -->  Logical value indicating True or False
# integers           int    -->  whole numbers such as 1,5,100
# Floating Point     Float  -->  Numbers with decimal point 1.4 3.0
# Strings            str    -->  Ordered sequence of Character "Ajai" '15'
# Lists         (DS) list   -->  Ordered sequence of Objects [1,"sam",50,20.7]
# Tuples        (DS) tup    -->  Ordered immutable sequence of objects (1,"apples",70.1)
# sets          (DS) set    -->  Unordered collection of unique {"1","frank"}
# Dictionaries  (DS) dict   -->  unordered Key:Value pairs {"name":"Ajai", "age":"30"}

# ******************* Variable Assignments ******************************************************************

# best practices from PEP8
# All names lower case.Seperated by _               --> changes_made = x+y
# Avoid using words of special meaning              --> list str
# maybe try to use Global variable names all caps   --> ORGINAL_VALUE = []

# python uses  Dynamic Typing meaning reassign varibles to different data types
# as opposed to static data types in other language
# eg  name = "Ajai"  later change that to lists  name = ["Ajai"]

# We can index odered data types or data structure
# eg string, lists, Tuples
#            fruit = "banana"
#      Character     b  a  n  a  n  a
#          Index ->  0  1  2  3  4  5
#  Reverse Index ->  0 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
#   fruit[0] is 'b'
# since dictionaries are unordered, we can pull of the value by using key
